# vpn_only_osx

## what is it?

Make your Mac to connect Internet only via VPN.

## setup

* install VPN client of your choice. Personally prefer Tunnelblick (https://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/). I set it to connect VPN just after run.
* run: `sh setup.sh YOUR_VPN_SERVER_IP`
* enjoy less spying on you :)

## disable

In case you want to disable VPN-only run: `pf_reset`
